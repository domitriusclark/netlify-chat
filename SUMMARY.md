# Project Summary

## What Was Built

A multi-model AI chat application using Astro, Mastra AI SDK, and Netlify AI Gateway. The app supports 10+ AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google with persistent conversation memory.

## Current State

### Working
- ✅ Frontend chat interface with streaming responses
- ✅ Model switching (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- ✅ Thread-based conversation management
- ✅ LibSQL/Turso database integration
- ✅ Local development with file-based SQLite
- ✅ Production deployment to Netlify
- ✅ AI Gateway integration (base64 decoding implemented)

### Needs Investigation
- ⚠️ Netlify AI Gateway not injecting individual API keys in `netlify dev`
  - `AI_GATEWAY` config is present and decoded correctly
  - Individual keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) are missing from `process.env`
  - Works in production but not in local `netlify dev`
  - Diagnostic endpoint available: `/api/debug-env`

## Known Issues

### AI Gateway Environment Variables

**Problem**: After deploying to production, the AI Gateway configuration (`AI_GATEWAY`) is available and correctly decoded in `netlify dev`, but the individual provider API keys are not being injected into `process.env`.

**What We Found**:
- `AI_GATEWAY` is base64-encoded JSON containing provider configuration
- Successfully decoded to show provider names and env var mappings
- Missing: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`

**Possible Causes**:
1. AI Gateway not fully activated for the site
2. Netlify CLI version compatibility
3. Site configuration issue
4. Account/billing limitation

**Debugging Steps for Netlify Team**:
1. Check `/api/debug-env` endpoint output
2. Verify AI Gateway is enabled in site settings
3. Check site build logs for AI Gateway activation
4. Verify `netlify env:list` output

**Workaround**: None currently. The app requires these env vars to function.

## Code Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/models.ts` - **Simplified to use `process.env` directly**, removed all Gateway config parsing
- `src/lib/memory.ts` - Simplified, removed console.logs
- `src/env.d.ts` - Cleaned up type definitions
- `README.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `.env.example` - Clarified AI Gateway usage
- `src/pages/api/debug-env.ts` - Diagnostic endpoint (dev-only, disabled in production)

### Files Removed
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Consolidated into README

### Code Simplification
The code now assumes Netlify AI Gateway injects standard environment variables directly:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` & `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` & `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` & `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL`

All Gateway config parsing and fallback logic has been removed for clarity.

## Architecture

```
User → Astro Frontend (React)
         ↓
     Netlify Functions (API routes)
         ↓
     Mastra AI SDK (Agent framework)
         ↓
     Netlify AI Gateway → AI Providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google)
         +
     LibSQL/Turso (Conversation memory)
```

## Next Steps

1. **For Netlify Engineers**: Investigate why AI Gateway isn't injecting API keys in `netlify dev`
2. **Once Fixed**: Test full flow in local development
3. **Future Enhancements**: See README roadmap section

## Diagnostic Tools

- **Debug Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8888/api/debug-env` (dev-only)
  - Shows which env vars are available
  - Displays AI Gateway config status
  - Provides troubleshooting recommendations
